    \title Kuesa Many Ducks C++ Example
    \ingroup kuesa-examples-cpp

    \brief Demonstrates the use of the Kuesa C++ API to import a glTF2 file and
    extract assets from it.

    \image manyducks-example.jpg

    \section1 Setting up a scene

    \section2 Creating a window

    The easiest way to get started is to subclass the Qt3DExtras::Qt3DWindow
    \snippet manyducks/main.cpp 0

    \section2 Creating a SceneEntity

    The \l {SceneEntity} will hold the assets we will load later. It will also
    act as our root entity.
    \snippet manyducks/main.cpp 0.1

    \section2 Creating a Camera and its controller

    We can reuse the default camera provided by Qt3DExtras::Qt3DWindow
    \snippet manyducks/main.cpp 0.2

    \section2 Setting up the FrameGraph

    We can use the pre made \l {ForwardRenderer} FrameGraph.
    \snippet manyducks/main.cpp 0.3

    \section2 Importing a glTF2 File

    In order to load a glTF2 file, Kuesa provides the \l {GLTF2Importer}
    element. If the \a sceneEntity property is set to a valid \l [QML]
    {SceneEntity} instance, Qt 3D assets generated while parsing the file will
    be automatically added to the various asset collections.
    \snippet manyducks/main.cpp 0.4

    \section2 Adding a Skybox

    Kuesa provides \l {Skybox}. It expects a patch and an extension.
    \snippet manyducks/main.cpp 0.5

    \section2 Adding a PostProcessing Effect

    We can use of of Kuesa's pre made post processing effects such as \l
    {DepthOfFieldEffect}.

    \snippet manyducks/main.cpp 0.6

    \section1 Extracting Assets from Collections

    Usually, you will want to interact with some elements of your scene.

    You can use the Kuesa Studio gltfEditor to introspect a glTF2 scene files
    and find the names of the various assets it contains.

    Upon successfull loading of our glTF2 file, we will be able to proceed with
    asset retrieval.
    \snippet manyducks/main.cpp 1

    \section2 Retrieving Geometries and Material

    Using the gltfEditor we know our scene files contains a Duck Entity name
    "KuesaEntity_0"..

    We can therefore retrieve it with:
    \snippet manyducks/main.cpp 1.1

    In turn, using Qt3D Component API, we can retrieve the Qt3DRender::QGeometry,
    Qt3DRender::QMaterial components of the previously retrieved entity.
    \snippet manyducks/main.cpp 1.2

    Then, we can create several entities referencing the same material and geometry.
    \snippet manyducks/main.cpp 1.3

    \section1 Animating our Scene

    Subclassing the timerEvent function on Qt3DExtras::Qt3DWindow allows us to
    add some logic to be executed at every frame.
    \snippet manyducks/main.cpp 2

    Please note that glTF2 offers way to embedded animations in the glTF files
    directly. This should be preferred unless you want to manually do animations
    like illustrated above.
