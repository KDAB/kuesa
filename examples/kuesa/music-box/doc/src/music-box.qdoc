    \title Kuesa Music Box QML Example
    \ingroup kuesa-examples-qml

    \brief Demonstrates the use of the Kuesa API to import a glTF2 file and play
    animations.

    \image music-box-example.jpg

    \section1 QtQuick and Qt3D integration

    The music-box example relies on the regular QtQuick and Qt 3D APIs to
    instantiate a QtQuick based application that combines Qt 3D based content
    with a 2D UI overlay.

    \section1 SceneEntity

    Kuesa provides the \l [QML] {SceneEntity} element which holds collections
    of Qt 3D assets accessible by name.

    \section1 Importing a glTF2 File

    In order to load a glTF2 file, Kuesa provides the \l {GLTF2Importer}
    element. If the \a sceneEntity property is set to a valid \l [QML]
    {SceneEntity} instance, Qt 3D assets generated while parsing the file will
    be automatically added to the various asset collections.

    \dots

    \section1 Extracting and running Animations

    We know in advance the name of the animations bundled in the glTF2 file. If
    you haven't authored the file yourself, you can use the \l {gltfEditor} to
    introspect it, list the animations and preview them.

    Given a list of animation names:
    \snippet music-box/qml/MainScene.qml 2.1
    \dots

    We can generate \l {AnimationPlayer} to control them.
    \snippet music-box/qml/MainScene.qml 2.2

    Upon importing the glTF file, we can rely on the status change to trigger
    the animation playback.
