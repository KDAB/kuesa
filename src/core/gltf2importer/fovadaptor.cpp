 This class is just an adaptor to convert radians coming from the yFov animation to degrees, expected by the Qt3DRender::QCamera
 We need a radians property so the Qt3DAnimation aspect can find it and therefore, we need read/write function, but we dont need to
 actually store any content.

 When the radians writer is called, we just convert the radians to degrees and emit the degreesChanged function which is connected
 to the QCamera::setFieldOfView in the importer
