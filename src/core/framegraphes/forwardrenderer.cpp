/*!
 * \class Kuesa::ForwardRenderer
 * \brief Implements a simple forward rendering FrameGraph.
 * \inmodule Kuesa
 * \since Kuesa 1.0
 * \inherits Qt3DRender::QFrameGraphNode
 *
 * This FrameGraph will select all Qt3D Entities that reference a Material with
 * Techniques having a FilterKey with the name "renderingStyle" set to the
 * string value "forward".
 *
 * The rendering will be made on a main viewport whose dimensions can be set
 * with normalized coordinates by calling ForwardRender::setViewportRect.
 *
 * The screen will be cleared with the color set by calling
 * ForwardRender::setClearColor. By default the clear color is black.
 *
 * Unless a call to ForwardRender::setClearBuffers has been made, only the
 * color and depth buffers will be cleared before the rest of the scene is
 * rendered.
 *
 * The scene will be rendered from the camera set with ForwardRender::setCamera
 * on the window or offscreen surface set by calling
 * ForwardRender::setRenderSurface. Additionally
 * ForwardRender::setExternalRenderTargetSize can be called to specify the size
 * of the rendering surface, when different from the size reported by the
 * surface, this can be the case with high DPI screens.
 *
 * Frustum culling of Entities will be performed by default to only render
 * entities that are visible within the camera's frustum. This can be disabled
 * by calling ForwardRender::setFrustumCulling. Please note frustum culling is
 * not performed on skinned meshes.
 *
 * By default the rendering is performed so that:
 *
 * Opaque object are rendered first: Entities having a Material with a
 * compatible RenderPass that has a FilterKey KuesaDrawStage with a value set
 * to Opaque will be rendered.
 *
 * Transparent objects are rendered second: select all Entities having a
 * Material with a compatible RenderPass that has a FilterKey KuesaDrawStage
 * with a value set to Transparent will be rendered.
 *
 * Scenes containing materials with transparency need to be drawn from
 * back-to-front in relation to the Camera for the blending to work correctly.
 * This sorting can be expensive and is disabled by default. It can be enabled
 * by calling ForwardRender::setBackToFrontSorting.
 *
 * In some case, an optimization technique known as an early z-filling pass can
 * provide a significant performance gain. This is especially true for large
 * scenes using complex rendering materials. The idea consist in filling the
 * depth buffer with a low complexity shader so that subsequent passes
 * incorporating more detailed rendering techniques only render fragments for
 * the depth previously recorded. The optional z-fill pass can be enabled by
 * calling ForwardRender::setZFilling. All Entities having a Material with a
 * compatible RenderPass that has a FilterKey KuesaDrawStage with a value set
 * to ZFill will be rendered. This will take place before the Opaque and
 * Transparent pass. Only Opaque objects should be used to fill the depth
 * buffer.
 *
 * The pipeline steps, from materials to post processing effects are working in
 * linear color space. This ForwardRenderer adds a final gamma correction to
 * perform the final conversion to sRGB, through the use of the
 * GammaCorrectionEffect, as the last step of this pipeline.

 *
 * This FrameGraph will select all Qt3D Entities that reference a Material with
 * Techniques having a FilterKey with the name "renderingStyle" set to the
 * string value "forward".
 *
 * The rendering will be made on a single viewport whose dimensions can be set
 * with normalized coordinates by setting the viewportRect property.
 *
 * The screen will be cleared with the color set with the clearColor property.
 * By default the clear color is black.
 *
 * Unless clearBuffers has been set appropriately, only the color and depth
 * buffers will be cleared before the rest of the scene is rendered.
 *
 * The scene will be rendered from the camera property on the
 * window or offscreen surface specified by the renderSurface property.
 * Additionally, setting externalRenderTargetSize will specify the
 * size of the rendering surface, when different from the size reported by the
 * surface, this can be the case with high DPI screens.
 *
 * Frustum culling of Entities will be performed by default to only render
