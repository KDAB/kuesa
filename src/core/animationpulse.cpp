    \brief Given a pulse animation, emits signals when the pulse goes up or down

    AnimationPulse is an utility class designed to let the designer encode certain
    events directly on the 3D design tool. Given an animation, it emits an up signal
    when qRound(animatedValue) increases and a down signal when qRound(animatedValue)
    decreases.

    In combination with a STEP pulse animation, a designer can encode the moment in which
    certain actions should happen, for example, pausing an animation, directly from
    the 3D design tool.

    \note To support AnimationPulse without any glTF extension, the animation should
    animate the translation property of a glTF.Node. In particular, the pulse fcurve
    should animate the "y" property of the translation.
