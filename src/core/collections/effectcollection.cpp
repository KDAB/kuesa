 * \inherits Kuesa::AbstractAssetCollection
 *
 * Kuesa::EffectCollection manages a set of Qt3DRender::QEffect assets.
 *
 * It also works as a factory and provides a way of creating instances of
 * effects based on a unique key.
 *
 * Factory functions are created by calling EffectCollection::registerType.
 *
 * These functions are used to create specific instances of QEffect derived
 * class when calling EffectCollection::addEffect.

 * If the asset has no parent, it will be reparented to the collection.

 * and deleted if parented to the collection.
