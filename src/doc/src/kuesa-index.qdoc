    \e{Kuesa} is a module for Qt 3D which provides:
    \list
    \li Support for glTF 2 importing
    \li Helpers for accessing and manipulating loaded content
    \li Custom PBR material
    \li Custom forward renderer for adding effects
    \li A Qt Creator template for quickly creating new Kuesa based projects
    \endlist

    \annotatedlist kuesa-module

    Application side features provided by Kuesa reside in the Kuesa Qt module.

    \section1 Getting Started

    For a C++ applications and C++/QML applications that performs 2D or 3D
    rendering leveraging the Kuesa and Qt 3D modules:

    \badcode
    QT += 3dcore 3drender 3dinput 3dlogic 3dextras 3danimation kuesa
    \endcode

    To include the definitions of the module's classes, use the following
    directives:

    C++:
    \badcode
    #include <Kuesa>
    \endcode

    QML:
    \badcode
    import Kuesa 1.0
    \endcode

    \section1 Quick Overview

    Kuesa aims at making it easier for both Artist and Developers to preview and
    integrate 3D scenes into a Qt based application.

    Kuesa provides an easy, integrated and unified workflow without any
    compromises for designers and developers based on the glTF 2 format.

    It is composed of 3 components:

    \section2 Kuesa Studio

    \section3 Kuesa Digital Content Creation Plugins

    \list
    \li \l {https://github.com/KDAB/kuesa-blender} {Kuesa Blender glTF2 Exporter plugin}
    \li \l {https://github.com/KDAB/kuesa-3dsmax} {Kuesa 3ds Max glTF2 Exporter plugin}
    \endlist

    \section3 Kuesa Studio Tools

    The Kuesa-Studio comes with a gltf tool to preview scenes.

    It also provides tools to condition assets to integrate as part of the
    build process.

    \section2 Kuesa Runtime
    Libraries on top of Qt 3D that provide:
    \list
    \li \l [CPP]{Kuesa::GLTF2Importer} {glTF2 compliant importer that generates a Qt 3D based scene}
    \li \l [CPP]{Kuesa::MetallicRoughnessMaterial} {Custom PBR materials}
    \li \l {Kuesa Iro Materials} {A library of simple and efficient materials to extend glTF}
    \li Asset collections to retrieve assets by name
    \li Post Processing Effects
    \endlist

    \section3 Tools

    The Kuesa-Runtime comes with the gltfViewer tool to preview scenes.

    \section1 Requirements

    \list
    \li Kuesa requires the base Qt 5.12 requirements and OpenGL supports.
    \li Kuesa requires Qt 3D from Qt 5.12.5, Qt 5.13.1 or later.
    \li Instructions on how to build Qt from source can be found \l {https://wiki.qt.io/Building_Qt_5_from_Git} {here}.
    \endlist

    \section2 OpenGL requirements
    \list
    \li Desktop OpenGL 3+
    \li OpenGL ES 3.2
    \li OpenGL ES 3.1 or lower is supported but with a limited feature set depending on available OpenGL extensions:
        \list
        \li For HDR support, GL_OES_texture_half_float is required
        \li For anti aliasing, ARB_texture_multisample and GL_EXT_color_buffer_half_float are required
        \endlist
    \endlist

    \section2 Optional Dependencies

    Kuesa can optionnally use the \l {https://github.com/google/draco} {Draco}
    mesh compression library, either through an embedded version, or a version
    present on the system. Draco can be used to dramatically decrease the size
    of glTF files.

    Kuesa supports the \c {KHR_draco_mesh_compression} glTF extension as defined \l {    https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/master/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_draco_mesh_compression/} {here}.

    By default, Kuesa will build with its own embedded version of the Draco library.
    This can be enforced with:

    \badcode
        qmake kuesa.pro -- --draco=qt
    \endcode

    To build Kuesa without any support for Draco, run qmake like this:

    \badcode
        qmake kuesa.pro -- --draco=no
    \endcode

    To build Kuesa with an external version of Draco, run qmake like this:

    \badcode
        qmake kuesa.pro -- --draco=system
    \endcode

    If Draco is not installed in the default location on your system, you can
    set the \c {DRACOSDK} environment variable to point to where Draco is
    installed. Use the \c {DRACOSDK_LIBS} environment variable to point to the
    folder containing the Draco libraries.

    Note that Kuesa has last been tested with Draco at commit
    8833cf878e6fd43c5a3fd6e4231212e25e25e632.

    The glTF editor, provided with Kuesa, is able to compress existing glTF 2.0
    assets with Draco.

    \section1 Installation

    Kuesa builds as a Qt module and will be installed alongside Qt.

    \badcode
        qmake
        make
        make install
    \endcode

    Should examples not be built, try:

    \badcode
        make sub-examples
        cd examples
        make install
    \endcode

    To install the Qt Creator template, copy the entire kuesa folder
    from \c {tools/qtc_templates} to the \c {templates/wizards} folder inside
    the Qt Creator install location.
