    \e{Kuesa Runtime} is a module for Qt 3D which provides:
    \list
    \li Support for glTF 2 importing
    \li Helpers for accessing and manipulating loaded content
    \li PBR and custom material support
    \li Custom forward renderer for adding effects
    \li A Qt Creator template for quickly creating new Kuesa based projects
    \endlist

    It is the developer facing part of the Kuesa 3D design and integration workflow.

    \section1 Getting Started

    For a C++ applications and C++/QML applications that performs 2D or 3D
    rendering leveraging the Kuesa and Qt 3D modules:

    \badcode
    QT += 3dcore 3drender 3dinput 3dlogic 3dextras 3danimation kuesa
    \endcode

    To include the definitions of the module's classes, use the following
    directives:

    C++:
    \badcode
    #include <Kuesa>

    int main(int ac, char **av)
    {
        QGuiApplication app(ac, av);
        Qt3DExtras::Qt3DWindow w;

        KuesaUtils::SceneConfiguration sceneConfiguration;
        sceneConf.setSource(QUrl("file:///path/to/file.gltf));
        sceneConf.setCameraName("CameraNameInGLTF");

        KuesaUtils::View3DScene view3d;
        view3d.setActiveScene(&sceneConfiguration);

        w.setRootEntity(&view3d);
        w.setActiveFrameGraph(view3d.frameGraph());
        w.show();

        return app.exec();
    }
    \endcode

    QML:
    \badcode
    import Kuesa 1.3
    import Kuesa.Utils 1.3

    View3D {
        id: scene3D
        multisample: true
        source: "file:///path/to/file.gltf"
        camera: "cameraNameInGLTF"
    }
    \endcode

    \section1 Quick Overview

    Kuesa aims at making it easier for both Artist and Developers to preview and
    integrate 3D scenes into a Qt based application.

    Kuesa provides an easy, integrated and unified workflow without any
    compromises for designers and developers based on the glTF 2 format.

    It is composed of 2 components:

    \include kuesa-components.qdocinc

    \l {Kuesa Overview} {Read More}

    \section1 Requirements

    Kuesa relies on the Qt framework:
    \list
    \li Kuesa requires the base \l {https://doc.qt.io/qt-5.15/supported-platforms.html} {Qt 5.15 requirements} and OpenGL support.
    \li Kuesa requires Qt 3D from Qt 5.15 or Qt 6.0
    \endlist

    \note Earlier Qt 3D versions can still be used but might be suffering from bugs
    that have been identified and fixed since.

    \section2 OpenGL requirements
    \list
    \li Desktop OpenGL 3+
    \li OpenGL ES 3.2
    \li OpenGL ES 3.1 or lower is supported but with a limited feature set depending on available OpenGL extensions:
        \list
        \li For HDR support, GL_OES_texture_half_float is required
        \li For anti aliasing, ARB_texture_multisample and GL_EXT_color_buffer_half_float are required
        \endlist
    \endlist

    \section2 Vulkan, Metal, DirectX requirements

    If using Qt 6.0, Kuesa can alternatively run on top of Vulkan, Metal or DirectX.

    \section2 Optional Dependencies

    Kuesa can optionally use the \l {https://github.com/google/draco} {Draco}
    mesh compression library, either through an embedded version, or a version
    present on the system. Draco can be used to dramatically decrease the size
    of glTF files.

    Kuesa supports the \c {KHR_draco_mesh_compression} glTF extension as defined \l {    https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/master/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_draco_mesh_compression/} {here}.

    By default, Kuesa will build with its own embedded version of the Draco library.
    This can be enforced with:

    \badcode
        qmake kuesa.pro -- --draco=qt
    \endcode

    To build Kuesa without any support for Draco, run qmake like this:

    \badcode
        qmake kuesa.pro -- --draco=no
    \endcode

    To build Kuesa with an external version of Draco, run qmake like this:

    \badcode
        qmake kuesa.pro -- --draco=system
    \endcode

    If Draco is not installed in the default location on your system, you can
    set the \c {DRACOSDK} environment variable to point to where Draco is
    installed. Use the \c {DRACOSDK_LIBS} environment variable to point to the
    folder containing the Draco libraries.

    Note that Kuesa has last been tested with Draco at commit
    8833cf878e6fd43c5a3fd6e4231212e25e25e632.

    \section1 Installation

    Kuesa builds as a Qt module and will be installed alongside Qt. The main
    advantage is that once installed, using Kuesa in your projects is as easy
    as adding

    \badcode
    QT += kuesa
    \endcode

    to your project file. The down side is that building Kuesa from source can
    be a little more complicated if you're not used to building Qt itself
    already.

    \note you DO NOT have to build Qt from source, building Kuesa against a
    pre-installed version of Qt should work fine.

    But building a module means that Kuesa has dependencies that are similar to
    those that apply when building Qt from source (Instructions on how to build
    Qt from source can be found
    \l {https://wiki.qt.io/Building_Qt_5_from_Git} {here}.

    In particular:
    \list
    \li perl must be installed and included in the PATH
    \li if you have downloaded Kuesa as an archive from github, you must create an empty ``.git`` folder at the
    root of the kuesa source directory.
    \endlist

    Once these are installed, `syncqt` will be able to generate the module headers at
    build time. Simply run:

    \badcode
        qmake
        make
        make install
    \endcode

    Should examples not be built, try:

    \badcode
        make sub-examples
        cd examples
        make install
    \endcode

    To install the Qt Creator template, copy the entire kuesa folder
    from \c {tools/qtc_templates} to the \c {templates/wizards} folder inside
    the Qt Creator install location.

    \section2 Clearing Stale Caches

    If you've updated Kuesa or have used Kuesa previously, it is recommended to
    clear the Qt 3D cached shader files.

    The cache is located at Qt::TempLocation which is usually
    ""C:/Users/<USER>/AppData/Local/Temp" on Windows and "/tmp" on Linux.

    Remove all the .qt3d files present at that location to ensure Kuesa rebuilds
    all the shaders with all the updates.
