    \title Kuesa Overview

    \brief Kuesa provides C++ and QML APIs to ease incorporation of 3D content
    into Qt 3D based applications.

    \section1 Basic Kuesa Features

    \section2 glTF 2 Importer

    The class Kuesa::GLTF2Importer is a Qt3DCore::QNode based class that allows
    loading glTF 2 files. glTF 2 files from any exporter should work, note however
    that the Kuesa specific exporter allow the use of additional features, namely:
    \list
    \li Qt 3D compatible PBR Material support
    \li Qt 3D layer export
    \li Face wireframe export
    \endlist

    Once a file has been loaded through the use of the glTF 2 importer, name based
    collections are populated. Kuesa provides the following collections for:
    \list
    \li Entities, Kuesa::EntityCollection
    \li Animation Clips, Kuesa::AnimationClipCollection
    \li Animation Mappings, Kuesa::AnimationMappingsCollection
    \li Cameras, Kuesa::CameraCollection
    \li Effects, Kuesa::EffectCollection
    \li Materials, Kuesa::MaterialCollection
    \li Meshes, Kuesa::MeshCollection
    \li Skeletons, Kuesa::SkeletonCollection
    \li Textures, Kuesa::TextureCollection
    \li Images, Kuesa::TextureImageCollection
    \endlist

    \section2 Full Screen Post Processing Effects

    Final screen composition can be customized through the use of post
    processing effects. The effects work along with the default provided
    Kuesa FrameGraph Kuesa::ForwardRenderer.

    Currently Kuesa provides the following effects:
    \list
    \li Bloom, Kuesa::BloomEffect
    \li Gaussian Blur, Kuesa::GaussianBlurEffect
    \li Opacity Masking, Kuesa::OpacityMask
    \li Thresholding, Kuesa::ThresholdEffect
    \endlist
