    \title Kuesa Iro Materials

    \brief The Kuesa Iro Materials are a set of simplified materials that can
    be used to extend glTF files.

    \since Kuesa 1.2

    Iro Materials are, in most cases, a replacement for the glTF PBR material.
    They are specifically developed for embedded targets where the use of the
    more complex PBR material would harm performances.

    The main advantages is that the Iro Materials offer a lighter material
    option where reflections are still possible, but not as expensive to run.
    These materials have been implemented through the \l {Kuesa Custom
    Materials} {Kuesa custom material glTF extension mecanism}. Second, they
    are easier to edit and work with. This is especially true when using the
    the Blender addon provided by Kuesa Studio which gives artists a real time
    preview of the IroMaterials.

    Note: You can get imperfect reflections when viewing your model from under,
    if your application allows the user to fully orbit around the model.

    All the Iro Materials are compatbile with OpenGL, Vulkan, Metal and DirectX
    when used with the latest Qt 3D version.

    \section1 Current Iro Materials

    \section2 Iro2 Materials

    A second revision of the Iro materials have been introduced in Kuesa 1.3.
    They provide support for normal maps and IroDiffuseHemi-like shadowing.

    \list
    \li \l {Iro2DiffuseSem}
    \li \l {Iro2DiffuseEquiRect}
    \li \l {Iro2AlphaSem}
    \li \l {Iro2AlphaEquiRect}
    \li \l {Iro2GlassSem}
    \li \l {Iro2GlassEquiRect}
    \li \l {Iro2MatteAlpha}
    \endlist

    \section2 Original Iro Materials

    \list
    \li \l {IroMatteOpaqueMaterial}
    \li \l {IroMatteSkyboxMaterial}
    \li \l {IroMatteBackgroundMaterial}
    \endlist

    \section1 Deprecated Iro Materials

    Those materials are kept for compatibility reasons. Use the corresponding
    Iro2 materials when possible.

    \list
    \li \l {IroDiffuseMaterial}
    \li \l {IroDiffuseHemiMaterial}
    \li \l {IroGlassAddMaterial}
    \li \l {IroMatteAlphaMaterial}
    \endlist
