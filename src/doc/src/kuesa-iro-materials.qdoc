    \title Kuesa Iro Materials

    \brief The Kuesa Iro Materials are a set of simplified materials that can
    be used to extend glTF files.

    \since Kuesa 1.2

    The Kuesa Iro Materials are a set of simplified materials that can be used
    to extend glTF files. They are in most cases replacement for the glTF PBR
    material. There are specifically developped for embedded targets where the
    use of the more complex PBR material would harm performances.

    These materials have been implemented through the \l {Kuesa Custom
    Materials} {Kuesa custom material glTF extension mecanism} . The Kuesa
    Addon for Blender 2.8 allows to create, preview and export the Iro
    materials.
